Student Name:   Section:   Date:  Information Assurance and Security   Learning Activities Scoresheet   |   Page   2   of   7  THREAT MODELING  Threat Model is usually a visual representation with documentation explaining each process  and any threats associated with it.  IDENTIFYING   SECURITY OBJECTIVES  The initial step in the threat modeling example is to gather as much background information as possible.  Business Case   Description  Company and Industry  Solution Requirements  Compliance Requirements  Quality of Service   Requirements  Assets  Team  Security Objective  CREATE AN APPLICATION OVERVIEW  In this step, you outline what your Web application does. Your goal is to identify your applicationΓÇÖs key  functionality, characteristics, and clients. Draw a rough   diagram that describes the composition and structure  of your application, its subsystems, and its deployment characteristics.  System Architecture
Learning Activities Scoresheet   |   Page   3   of   7  Application Overview   Description  Roles  Key Usages  Technologies  Security Mechanism  DECOMPOSE YOUR APPLICATION  In this step, you break down your application to identify trust boundaries, data flows, entry points, and exit  points. The more you know about the mechanics of your application, the easier it is to uncover threats and  discover vulnerabilities.   Architectural diagrams and overviews of the proposed application design help in  creating a DFD.  Data Flow Diagram
Learning Activities Scoresheet   |   Page   4   of   7  IDENTIFY THREATS AND VULNERABILITITES  In this step, you identify threats and attacks that might   affect your application and compromise your security  objectives. These threats are the bad effects that could happen to your application.   STRIDE methodology  introduced by Microsoft can be used to identify threats. As a next step, STRIDE threat modeling against each  component (known as component - based STRIDE threat modeling) can be performed .
Learning Activities Scoresheet   |   Page   5   of   7  RATE AND PRIORITIZE THREATS  DREAD methodology is used to rate, compare, and prioritize the severity of risk presented by each threat that  is classified using STRIDE. To determine the ranking of a threat, the threat analyst must answer basic questions  for each factor of risk.
Learning Activities Scoresheet   |   Page   6   of   7  IDENTIFY COUNTERMEASURES AND MITIGATIONS  Once threats have been identified, compared, and prioritized using threat modeling method it is   time to  define countermeasures to those threats. Note that countermeasures to threats can also be called security  requirements or threat mitigations.
